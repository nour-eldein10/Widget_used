 difference between transform and matrix :


Transform.rotate(), Transform.scale(), Transform.translate() = SIMPLE widgets (do one thing)

Transform() with Matrix4 = COMPLEX widget (can do multiple things at once)

thats why you use transform you can't make alot of animations ,then matrix4 solve these 


usage:

transform -> when apply animatoin on different obejects 

matrix4 -> apply more than animtation to same object


important notes:

transform -> Order matters when use rotate then translate or otherwrise
matrix4 ->operations happen in REVERSE order (last operation happens first)!


Structure:

Matrix4.identity() = 
[1, 0, 0, 0]  // X: no change
[0, 1, 0, 0]  // Y: no change  
[0, 0, 1, 0]  // Z: no change
[0, 0, 0, 1]  // Perspective: no change
